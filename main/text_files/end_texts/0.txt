Exhausted and jaded from your journey, the memories of your daughter have led you through the galaxy. On the highest of the mountains that you have ever visited you find a wrecked car. On the ground next to the car there are flowers and candles. You see how your daughter opens the door and she is rescued by a paramedic. There are people all around the crash site now.
