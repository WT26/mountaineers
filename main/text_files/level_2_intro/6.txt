Warm rays from the sun touch your face as you watch the river flowing under the bridge.  You start to forget the ache in your heels after a long travel across the park. You look down at the flowing river together and it responds by painting a figure of you. The sunlight changes the color of your clothes on the figure drawn on the surface of the water. “Look, there are different versions of us! If you were young again, would there be something that you would do differently?” your daughter asks.
