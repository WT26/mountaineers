You kneel down and search your pockets and your equipment thoroughly. When you finally find batteries and get your flashlight working, you cannot see your daughter anywhere. You call her name, but there is no answer, your yells dissipate in the deep woods. In the distance you hear howling wolves and a scream. You spot wolves' footprints that are going the same way as the screams.
