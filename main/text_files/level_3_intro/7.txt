When you reach the top of the tower, you find that the door is open. There are only used mugs, empty bottles of rum, and a notification. It`s made by someone called Sandra. You start to read the text: 'Retired. After years as a forest ranger, my heart finally found it's way back to the city'. The only map in the room has teared in the middle. As you run back down the stairs you see blood on the trail. You feel pain in your chest and a strong anger fills you. Your time together flashes in front of your eyes. Why did you take your daughter with you to the woods when she just wanted to play with her friends. Why did you risk your daughter`s life because of your own hobby?
