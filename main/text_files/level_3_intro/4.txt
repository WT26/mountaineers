You tell your daughter to follow you as you make your way towards the car fast. You feel exhausted and have to stop for a while, but when you turn around your daughter has disappeared. Somewhere in the near distance you hear your daughter yelling for help. You call her name but she seems to not hear you. You hear wolves howling. It seems the screams and howls are coming from the same place.
